    <h3>15)&nbsp;&nbsp;Mavradoxa - <i>Lethean Lament</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Okay, look -- I’m not kidding myself. Rochester, NY’s Mavradoxa sounds a lot like Agalloch. No, I mean A LOT. They have got that formula about as nailed as can be. But given that Agalloch is one of my all-time favorites, I’m not exactly inclined to take issue with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the acoustic guitar of intro “Cicadan” comes trickling out of the speakers there’s really no questioning the Agalloch influence, and first proper song “The Phantom Visages” certainly doesn’t dissuade one from it either. It contains those hallmark elements of the Agalloch sound to an incredible degree. The pervasive melancholy, the harsh vocals hanging out in the mid-range (and their inflection), the guitars that are stony and cold on the rhythms but warm and rich on the leads, and the powerfully pagan aesthetic -- they’re all here.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is not to say there is no deviation in flavor, though. Both bands are fine wines, each reflecting their character a little differently. Where Mavradoxa really excels is in their melodic attack, and the final few minutes of “The Phantom Visages” provide a fine example. Melody bursts forth astride some great tremolo picking, albeit slower than most black metal. But when a second guitar joins for the dual harmony, it sounds amazing. Granted, there is only guitarist in the band so some studio trickery is afoot, but the result is nonetheless spectacular. The album then moves into its powerhouse piece, the immense, almost-18-minute “Crimson Waves of Autumnal Flame.” Here again the Agalloch qualities are operating at peak capacity, but the riffs are something special -- so damned gorgeous and evocative. In terms of pure intensity, “From Fog” claims the honor, charging out of the gate with spellbinding trem picking. It just gets better from there, melodies and rhythms playing off one another, swirling together in an intoxicating mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something I often repeat is that I don’t mind if a band seems to ape the sound of another band. But they had better do a damn good job of it, and let their own sincerity shine through the material. Mavradoxa does just that, and listening to “Lethean Lament” is a pure pleasure. In the end, that’s what matters most.

    <h3>14)&nbsp;&nbsp;Scáth na Déithe - <i>Pledge Nothing but Flesh</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      I’ve never been a huge death metal guy. There are undeniable classics, especially from the Swedish scenes of the early and mid-1990s, but my heart just doesn’t lie with many subgenres of the style. These days, “cavernous” blackened death metal seems all the rage, and bands such as Zhrine and Altarage deliver some impressive work in the area. Still, while I appreciate what they do, I stop a bit short of completely clicking with it. Ah, but then we have Ireland’s Scáth na Déithe…
    </p>
      “Pledge Nothing but Flesh” is a frothing, voracious beast of a record. It is massively heavy and claustrophobia-inducing, but where it truly succeeds is in how it equally wields melody as a deadly weapon. Early track “Bloodless” is the prime example. For about half of its crushing, nearly 11-minute running time, it is not unlike the other aforementioned bands, blasting away through a soup of roaring, high-paced death with strongly blackened overtones. But at that midpoint, beware. The ensuing melodic assault is fucking gargantuan, an unstoppable force barreling across the sonic landscape, punctuated by wallops of bass. After a breakdown highlighting the percussion, and then a return to tense black metal pacing, that melody returns right on the heels of vocalist Cathal Hughes vomiting forth a ragged roar that goes on and on. And then just keeps going via some freakish skill that defies logic, as well as the human inability to expel that much breath and sound for that period of time. It is as shocking as it is devastating. The rest of the record showcases plenty of vitality, but honestly this monstrous track makes the album.“Pledge Nothing but Flesh” is a frothing, voracious beast of a record.

It is as shocking as it is devastating. The rest of the record showcases plenty of vitality, but honestly this monstrous track makes the album.
    <p>
      “This Unrecognized Disease” is no slouch though, heaping on more razor-sharp melody to complement the punishing low end and rhythmic attack. It’s followed by a moving instrumental entitled “Fáilte na Marbh,” which provides a nice break in the action, which is in turn followed by a juggernaut of melodic menace in the form of “The Shackled Mind.” And here again Hughes delivers sustained vocal blasts that, while not as lengthy as that of “Bloodless,” are still mightily impressive. Closing track “Search Unending” kicks into hyperspeed, but its final moments are somber and desolate, a fitting finale for this grim and merciless celebration of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scáth na Déithe is what you might get if their countrymen Altar of Plagues decided to start playing cavernous death metal while keeping their melodic black metal core intact. Or if they had an evil love child with Zhrine. Either of these fantasies would have been preferable to Altar of Plagues breaking up a few years ago, but I won’t complain about having these savage brethren in their stead.

    <h3>13)&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of Crom - <i>The Black Tower</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Holy heavy metal! There’s nothing like an album that captures the heavy metal spirit, and there really aren’t many that truly do that. But this Finnish/Swedish duo doesn’t just capture it, they fucking bleed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They’re a bit of an unusual act for the the black-metal-dominated Nordvis label, but that makes them stand out all the more. And actually, after a soaring, keyboard-driven intro, “The Fire Reborn” does explode with some blackened fury. But make no mistake, “The Black Tower” is first and foremost about epic heavy metal. Vocals are frequently delivered in a clean, monastic style, and this approach works beautifully and conjures feelings of power and glory. It’s not unfair to liken the musical direction to classic Hammerfall or Helloween, but only in the best possible way. Wailing guitars and driving, fist-pumping rhythms are often the stock in trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fall of Pandemonium” tears it up with a rollicking, classic In Flames bridge, held up on either side by powerhouse melodies. “Legacy” is the ballad of the bunch, a gentle and melancholy tune that brings to mind English folk metallers Forefather. The mid-tempo giant “Black Wings up High” is not only at the center of the album, it truly is the centerpiece with its stomping, doomy riffs that would be at home on a Grand Magus album. “Summoning the Starborn” is the only other track to take a black metal approach at points, sounding brilliantly like Panopticon when it does so. “Viimeinen Laki” summons some classic Amorphis, while “Rebirth of the Sun” closes out the record with a guest violinist bringing some lovely strains to this moving instrumental track.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Black Tower” is an inspiring slab of metal greatness. Always genuine, never cheesy, it’s a reminder of what true heavy metal is, or can be. Hail these mighty sons!

    <h3>12)&nbsp;&nbsp;Xenotaph - <i>Media Morte in Vita Sumus</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Sifting through the number of black metal releases I’m exposed to each year is daunting to say the very least. The genre is alive and well, and not lacking in quality. It comes in a diverse array of flavors, from traditional to modern to avantgarde, Satanic to pagan to urban, and everything in between. Deciphering all that and letting it percolate takes time, but when I first heard this Xenotaph album (which I came to through another black metal band posting about them -- the scene perpetuates itself!), I loved it instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old-schoolers can rejoice, because these Oakland boys are following the classic methods. Black-and-white Satanic cover art, a spindly logo with a giant inverted cross in it, and harsh production all define the aesthetic here. For me, though, it’s mostly about the guitar work. “Inversion Ritual” is a fine opener, and teases a bit with solid tremolo picking, but “Burning Core of the Psyche” really heats things up, no pun intended. Or perhaps it ices them down, since Xenotaph is more about the cold and grim. No matter how you slice it, the driving, furious guitars here are just fantastic, and drenched in atmosphere. “Bound in Eternal Opposition” brings more wickedly hypnotic axe attacks, and sounds a bit like Mutilation Rites, but not before a rocking intro that brings to mind Uada, who made one of the previous year’s best BM albums. It’s appreciated when black metal doesn’t get so caught up in “evil” and atmosphere that it forgets to simply kick ass. This is METAL, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the traditional character of the album, it does in fact have Cascadian black metal elements, which is a relatively more recent style. “Martyred in Trinity” is just one song that illustrates that, but what makes the Xenotaph approach successful is how those Pacific Northwest riffs are wrapped so thoroughly in frozen Norwegian atmosphere, that a new synthesis is created among the sounds. For all the superb tracks here, “At War With Creation” probably highlights that union in my favorite way, with a ripping central trem melody that’s total black metal perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, “Media Morte…” succeeds because it comes across as incredibly genuine. The sound, the riffs, the atmosphere, and just the total badassery make it a ravishing storm of hellish, blackened thrills. When I read reviews of contemporary metal albums, I see a lot of bitching about things sounding stale or unoriginal, but music of this quality never grows tiresome.

    <h3>11)&nbsp;&nbsp;Void Ritual - <i>Heretical Wisdom</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Void Ritual rises from the evil, grim wasteland of...Albuquerque, NM? Not exactly the first location that comes to mind for frigid black metal. But hey, “Breaking Bad” was set there, so that’s something. Ultimately, location is rendered irrelevant because this album is overflowing with vicious, top-notch blackened mayhem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another one-man project, Void Ritual is Daniel Jackson, and he brings formidable songwriting and musical skills to bear. First and foremost, the magic behind “Heretical Wisdom” is definitely the guitar. Track after track, the tone and emotion of the tremolo melodies are rock-solid. They’re often in the Cascadian style, so owe their sound to Wolves in the Throne Room, and before that the mighty Weakling. A song such as the title track, however, switches things up and has an epic feel akin to folk-tinged black metal stalwarts Forefather or Moonsorrow. The American melodies are where Void Ritual really tears shit up, though. Opener “The Flood” is a rabid beast, its melodic madness flashing from gleaming, murderous eyes. “Breathing Ice” is more elegant, more sophisticated, yet countered by husky, growling vocals that impart a death metal feel. On that note, the vocal quality is another big factor in the album’s success, as Jackson’s roar is hurled upon the listener with total conviction, powerfully driving the tracks forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Frozen Altar” is swirling, hypnotic bliss, while “Dead in Blackest Night” is a little more old school upfront, more Swedish a la Marduk, but quickly regains its Cascadian footing and weaves another melodic spell. It’s the shortest track here, and also the fastest, striking with lethal speed for its entirety. “The Maelstrom” is precisely that, an unstoppable storm of total fury, and again I hear some Moonsorrow at their most intense. It appears to let up briefly just past the midway point, offering up some cool Primordial-style riffs, and then lets fly with the greatest singular passage of the record, slicing everything in a one-mile radius to ribbons with its obscenely amazing melodic barrage. Try listening to this one without suffering a massive air guitar freakout.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heretical Wisdom” will have you raising the horns time and time again. As far as I’m concerned, it’s exactly what black metal ought to be -- aggressive but mesmerizing, and simultaneously wicked and beautiful. Contact Heisenberg for a gram of the pure blue stuff and enjoy some arid desert blackness.

    <h3>10)&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Drive-In - <i>in•ter a•li•a</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      To say that I approached new At the Drive-In material -- after 17 years! -- with some trepidation is an understatement. This seminal post-hardcore/punk band was legendary, but for me their split into the bands Sparta and The Mars Volta would prove even more important. Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez were the heart of progressive rock luminaries The Mars Volta, and I fully adore that band. I didn’t know what to expect from them reigniting ATDI after all these years, especially because TMV themselves called it quits in 2013. There was a serious lack of Bixler-Zavala/Rodriguez-Lopez in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well it turned out that I could dare to hope and dream, as “in•ter a•li•a” delivers beyond my expectations. All the classic ATDI energy is present, the tracks flailing away with fervor that is almost endlessly catchy. Even better, these songs aren’t just a rehash of the ATDI style. Rather they effectively bridge this band with TMV, to my great delight. Take, for example, “Pendulum in a Peasant Dress.” Its bridge could comfortably sit astride most TMV albums. But more than specifics, there’s an overall progressive vibe that links the bands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the annoyingly upbeat “Tilting at the Univendor,” every track here is gold. Despite the long hiatus, the band hasn’t missed a beat, and the playing is tight, concise, and potent. Aside from the brilliantly moody “Ghost-Tape No. 9,” these tracks all rock like hell, and Bixler-Zavala’s vocals are frequently fiery and bursting at the seams. One of the things I love most about TMV, and to a degree ATDI, is how they play with language. TMV is notorious for forming quirky and beguiling portmanteaus, evident in album titles such as “Amputecture” and “Noctourniquet.” ATDI’s lingual gymnastics are more at the verse level, but equally alluring. Of special mention are “Holtzclaw,” with its raging punk breakdowns and fantastic line “Church ain’t over ‘til they put the snakes back in the bag!”; “Torrentially Cutshaw” with its classic ATDI guitar histrionics and odd utterances such as “2000...tastes of pure captigon” [sic]; and finale “Hostage Stamps” (the title itself an amusing pun) with its rallying cry of “Raise your nithing poles!” ATDI is such a thinking person’s rock band that one is compelled to go to a dictionary to decipher the lyrics. I learned a nithing pole is used for cursing an enemy in Germanic pagan tradition. Who knew? The whole track is a lyrical goldmine though, with the full chorus going:
    </p>
    <p>
    “30 days spent in the hole<br>
    Raise yourself a nithing pole<br>
    Inoculated at the liquor store<br>
    Drunk on the piss of semaphore embers”<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a lot of sense? Nope. Still utterly inspired genius? Damn straight. It has to be heard, but the intensity is off the scale, and it all works so perfectly. A great album should always end well, and you just can’t ask for a better ending than this song. I can’t ever hear it without my pulse racing and heart thudding, and it makes me want to jump around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so At the Drive-In is well and truly back in action. They are not and never will be The Mars Volta, but “in•ter a•li•a” may well be as close as I ever get again. I’ll gladly take it.
